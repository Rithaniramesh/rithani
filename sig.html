<P>Improving Spatial Resolution of Raman DTS Using Total Variation Deconvolution</P>
<p><b><u>Description::</b></u></P>
<P> 
Ancient Raman distributed optical sensor (DTS) exhibits an occasional-pass characteristic that causes sharp temperature changes to be over smoothed. This behavior will be modeled as the convolution of the real temperature profile with the DTS impulse response. This paper presents a deconvolution algorithm developed to enhance the spatial resolution of a Raman DTS system. The algorithm is based on a linear DTS model and total variation regularization. The main advantage is the flexibility to properly reconstruct hot regions with dimensions down to fifteen cm, which represents a resolution gain of up to six times when compared with the DTS spatial resolution of one m. We present simulations and experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methodology.</P>

<p><b><u>STATEMENT 2::</b></u></p>
<P>: Service analytics for IT service management</P>
<p><b><u>Description::</b></u></P>
<P> Outsourcing enterprise IT service management is an increasingly difficult business. On one hand, service providers should deliver with respect to customer expectations of service quality and innovation. On the other hand, they must continuously seek competitive reductions in the prices of service delivery and management. These targets will be achieved with integration of innovative service management tools, automation, and advanced analytics. During this paper, we concentrate on service analytics, the subset of analytics issues and solutions concerning specific service delivery and management performance and price optimization. The paper reviews numerous service analytics ways and technologies that are developed and applied to boost IT service management. We tend to use our industrial expertise to spotlight the challenges faced in the event and adoption of service analytics, and we tend to discuss open problems.</P>

<p><b><u>STATEMENT 3::</b></u></p>
<P>SAR image segmentation based on active contours with fuzzy logic</P>
<p><b><u>Description::</b></u></P>
<P>During this paper, a fuzzy weighted active contour model for synthetic aperture radar image segmentation is proposed. A feature-primarily based approach comprising weighted active contours and level set segmentation is used to enhance segmentation results. A fuzzy inference engine is used to assign weights to pixels of the level set function based mostly on local entropy and local variance. Experiment results show that the proposed theme improves the segmentation efficiency and accuracy as compared with the prevailing region-scalable fitting scheme.</P>
