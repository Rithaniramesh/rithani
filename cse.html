<p><font color="Blue">Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an engineering discipline that covers several topics related to computation, programming languages, program design, computer hardware and software and integrates several fields of computer science. It is one of the trending subjects which students pursue after completing Class 12. CSE is a four-year undergraduate course which involves various aspects needed for the creation of a computer system.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. Oracle has a network of device partners.
Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.

You can’t go far without using software. From the alarm that wakes you up, the car you drive to work in, to the laptop you use when you arrive, it’s almost impossible to avoid. Not that you’d want to, because software is an integral part of almost every device that makes your daily life easier. Mobile phones, computers, home appliances, public transportation, and the emergency services all rely on intelligent software to make the most of their technology.

As a software engineer, you’ll be the one designing it. Applying your technical skills to the invention and innovation of software, along with the development, maintenance, and management of it, you’ll be able to use your love for technology to make a difference in the world. And you’ll make good money while doing it.

A communication network refers to how information flows within the organization. Information within an organization generally flows through a system, rather than being a free flow. Communication networks are regular patterns of person-to-person relationships through which information flows in an organization. This means that the flow of information is managed, regulated. and structured. Communication networks may be formal or informal.
